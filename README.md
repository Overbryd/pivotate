A handy extension that enables you to submit new stories right from your browser.

## Credits

The original idea for this extension comes from [latentflip/pivotate](https://github.com/latentflip/pivotate). But its screenshot feature didn't work any more, and I was not able to fix the existing codebase. That is why I made a rewrite using jQuery and a slightly different interface.
